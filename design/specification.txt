Idea:
Paperless Pub quiz app that removes the need to pub owners to hire a quiz master and provides a platform to host their own unique quiz with either randomly
generated questions or questions submitted by users.

Requirements:
- Pub owners shouble be able to create their own unique quiz

- Players should be able to register for a quiz given a session number

- Players and pub owners can create their own questions for quizzes and then pub owners can use those questions

- Team rankings should be shown between each round and the end of the quiz

Why is it useful:
Reduces costs (Monetery and potentially time wise if the pub owner creates their own questions)
Makes quizes fairer as players can no longer google answers while using the app
More convienient for players, don't have to leave there seat to submit answers
